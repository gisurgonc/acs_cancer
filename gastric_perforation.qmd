# Gastric CA + Perforation {#gastric_perforation}

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Spontaneous or s/p procedure?
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Evidence of intra-abdominal fluid on CT?

Patients with perforated gastric cancer need multidisciplinary emergency management.
