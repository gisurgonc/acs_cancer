# Gastric CA + Bleeding {#gastric_bleeding}

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Presence of exophytic mass on CT scan
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Evidence of intra-abdominal fluid on CT?

Patients with a bleeding gastric mass are generally due to adenocarcinoma or GI Stromal Tumors (GIST). In most cases, a provisional diagnosis of GIST can be made on CT scan, as these present with a localized mass and frequetnly have a large exophytic component. See [Bleeding GIST](#gist_bleeding)
