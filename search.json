    "text": "2.5 Background\nBleeding from esophageal cancer usually occurs in the context of anticoagulation or anti-platelet therapy. Once these are stopped, bleeding usually stops. Because bleeding can lead to an earlier diagnosis, some patients with bleeding may be a candidate for early surgery if they are shown to be T2 N0 M0 on staging. Patient with small bleeding tumors should undergo EUS once stabilized. EUS can be helpful is distinguishing T2 N0 (which are candidates for primary surgery) vs T3 or N1 (which should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy \\(\\pm\\) radiation prior to surgery).\n\n2.5.1 Endoscopic Therapy\nA series of 45 patients with bleeding esophageal cancer from Cologne included 24 patients with active bleeding of whom 20 were treated with endoscopic therapy including argon beam coagulation with control of bleeding in 18 (Allo et al., 2023)\n\n\n2.5.2 Radiation Therapy\nFor patients who have not had prior radiation therapy, urgent radiation therapy can be helpful for bleeding gastric cancer (Kondoh et al., 2015) (Kawabata et al., 2017) (Sugita et al., 2022) (and likely for esophageal cancer as well)\n\n\n2.5.3 Aortoesophageal fistula\nAortoesophageal fistula is fatal in the majority of cases. The classic description of Chiari’s triad consists of mid-sternal chest pain, herald bleed, and exanguination after a period without symptoms(Carter et al., 1978). A series from Taiwan( where most cases of esophageal cancer are squamous cell) of 249 patients with bleeding esophageal cancer, found aortoesophageal fistula to be the cause in 12%. Aortoesophageal fistula can also occur after endoluminal stent placement\nSuccessful treatment has been described using Thoracic EndoVacular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) and endoluminal stenting.(Chen et al., 2021) (Canaud et al., 2014) (Sakai et al., 2024)\n\n\n\n\nAllo, G., Bürger, M., Chon, S.-H., Gülcicegi, D., Krämer, L., Goeser, T., Kütting, F., 2023.

    "text": "3.5 Background\nPatients with esophageal obstruction from cancer need treatment of electrolyte and fluid abnormalities, nutritional support, and venous access for administration of chemotherapy.\n\n3.5.1 Laparoscopic Gastrostomy\nLaparoscopic gastrostomy is the preferred method for enteral access in patients with esophageal cancer for surgeons familiar with esophageal reconstruction. The stomach is the preferred method of reconstruction during esophagectomy and it is critical that gastrostomy placement not complicate future surgery. Gastrostomy tubes are more convenient for the patient as feedings can be done by bolus feedings, while jejunostomy feeding requires a pump over extended periods (12-16 hours).\nThe laparoscopic approach allows placement of the tube away from the right gastroepiploic artery. Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube). Operative Description of Laparoscopic Gastrostomy\n\n\n3.5.2 Laparoscopic Jejunostomy\nJejunostomy is the traditional method of nutritional support for patients with esophageal obstruction. This avoids the risk of injury to the future gastric conduit at the time of esophagectomy.\nDescription of operative setup for laparoscoic jejunostomy\nPostoperative Care for Jejunostomy\n\n\n3.5.3 Endoscopic stents\nEndoscopic stents to treat esophageal obstruction are appropriate in patients with documented metastatic disease (Stage IV) and those who will never be candidates for surgery.\nIn patients who are potentially candidates for esophagectomy, stents are generally avoided to prevent complications of surgery through fibrosis of the esophagus proximal to the tumor.\nA retrospective study of patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia (Min et al., 2017) found that treatment with gastrostomy was associated with longer survival than those treated with a endoscopic stent and had higher albumin levels and less need for re-intervention.\n\n\n3.5.4 Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy\nFor patients with Stage IV disease, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is indicated for nutritional support. A gastrostomy allows for bolus feeding and is more convenient for patients than a jejunostomy, which requires an infusion pump.\nFor patients with potentially resectable disease, PEG is avoided to prevent injury to the right gastroepiploic artery and the risk of tumor seeding of the gastrostomy tract.\n\n\n3.5.5 Central Venous Port\nCentral venous port can facilitate the administration of chemotherapy but is not essential in the acute management of patients with esophageal cancer, particularly patients with poor performance status who may not receive chemotherapy once they meet with their treating medical oncologist. Inpatient medical oncology consultation can help sort out which patients are not candidates for chemotherapy.\n\n\n\n\nMin, Y.W., Jang, E.Y., Jung, J.H., Lee, H., Min, B.-H., Lee, J.H., Rhee, P.-L., Kim, J.J., 2017.

    "text": "4.4 Background\nPerforated esophageal cancer most commonly occurs after endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, or dilation of an esophageal cancer (or benign stricture). Endoscopic stenting is frequently not feasible due to the underlying stricture. Treatment options are conservative management with drainage and IV antibiotics, endoluminal stenting, or emergency surgery. (Abu-Daff et al., 2016)\n\n4.4.1 Diagnosis\nCT esophagram with water soluble contrast is the diagnostic study of choice(Suarez-Poveda et al., 2014). This should include CT neck and/or CT abdomen/pelvis depending upon the suspected level of perforation.\nA study from Colorado (Madsen et al., 2023) of 65 patients transferred with suspected esophageal perforation found that 24 patients were ultimately found not to have a perforation. Among patients for whom pneumomediastinum was their sole criteria for transfer, only 57% were ultimately found to have a perforation. Among patients with a pleural effusion prior to transfer, 83% were ultimately found to have a perforation. Patients with a lactate greater than 1.6 were 11 times more likely to have aperforation.\n\n\n4.4.2 Cervical esophageal perforation\nContained perforations of the cervical esophagus can be treated with NPO and IV antibiotics. Uncontained perforations need surgical exploration. In this case, nutritional support with gastrostomy is indicated.\n\n\n4.4.3 Thoracic esophageal perforations\nPittsburgh esophageal perforation scoring system: (Abbas et al., 2009) Validation of Pittsburgh scoring system (Schweigert et al., 2016)\nA series from Birmingham UK of 74 esophageal perforations over 15 years include 13 patients with perforated cancers, of whom 7 were treated with endoscopic stenting (Charalampakis et al., 2023). These 13 patients had a 1-year mortality of 77%\n\n\n4.4.4 Conservative management\nThere is little experience in the literature for the conservative management of perforated esophageal cancer. Most clinical reports exclude patients with perforated cancers. A report from Kenya of 10 perforations among 492 dilations of esophageal cancer, of whom 9 were successfully treated with endoluminal stents (White et al., 2003). Stenting of perforated esophageal cancer is limited to case reports (Kobayashi et al., 2019)\n\n\n4.4.5 Emergent surgery\nEmergency esophagectomy is the traditional approach to perforated esophageal cancer given the difficulty in stenting an area of tumor (or stricture). Short-term goals are fluid resuscitation, IV antibiotics, and drainage of the pleurae (and abdomen).\nEmergent esophagogastrectomy via an abdominal and thoracic approach is the conventional approach in a fit patient.

The stomach is the preferred method of reconstruction during esophagectomy and it is critical that gastrostomy placement not complicate future surgery. Gastrostomy tubes are more convenient for the patient as feedings can be done by bolus feedings, while jejunostomy feeding requires a pump over extended periods (12-16 hours).\nThe laparoscopic approach allows placement of the tube away from the right gastroepiploic artery. Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).
