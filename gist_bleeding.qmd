# GIST + Bleeding {#gist_bleeding}

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Presence of exophytic mass on CT scan
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Evidence of intra-abdominal fluid on CT?

Bleeding from GI Stromal Tumors can occur either intraluminal or intr-abdominal.  Patients with intra-abdominal bleeding may have tumor rupture.

These patients frequently need emergency surgery

## Triage Team

Red LCI SO 


## Acute Management

-   CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast
-   Transfusion
-   Advanced GI Consultation (for endoscopic management of bleeding)

## Inpatient Management

-   Most patients will need surgical exploration.

## Background

GIST tumors have a characteristic appearance on CT scan.  Frequently, the endoscopic appearance is that of a submucosal mass. Endoscopic biopsies are frequently negative.  Histologic diagnosis may require EUS with FNA.
