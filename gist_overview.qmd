# GIST Overview {#gist_overview}

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Upper GI bleeding requiring transfusion? Is bleeding persistent?
-   Can patient maintain hydration orally?

Patients with a globular mass on CT or submucosal tumor are likely at [GI Stromal Tumor](gist_overview.html)

[Bleeding GIST](gist_bleeding.html)
[Perforated GIST](gist_perforation.html)

## Workup

## CT Scan

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contast will look for metastatic disease (most likely in liver) and assist surgical planning.

## Endoscopic ultrasound

EUS may be required for the diagnosis as patients fequently present with a submucosal mass and endoscopic biopsies can be benign.
