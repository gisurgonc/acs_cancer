# GIST + Perforation {#gist_perforation}

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Presence of exophytic mass on CT scan
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Evidence of intra-abdominal fluid on CT?

Perforation from GI Stromal Tumors is unusual and likely is accompanied by tumor rupture. These patients should be transferred emergently to CMC Main for consideration of surgery.

## Triage Team
